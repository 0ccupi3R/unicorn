* slimmed down powershell injection code even more
* when using windows/meterpreter/reverse_https, the option flags StagerURILength=5 StagerVerifySSLCert=false are specified in order to trim down payload. This is due to char restriction sizes when pasting into a command window. With these two settings, the codebase is slimmed down significantly and fits within the normal length
